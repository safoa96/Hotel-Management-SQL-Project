2.2. Business Rules and Logic
The hotel package tracking system incorporates various business rules and logic to ensure the hotels offer a convenient and satisfactory service to their customers. In this section, a comprehensive list of the business rules and logic that must be taken care of when designing the hotel package tracking system is presented.
2.2.1. Data Entry
Guests are automatically registered in the system when they book the hotel online. Information such as their names, addresses, contact details are collected in an online form. This information could also be collected automatically from if they book the hotel in person, the data is manually entered into the system by the hotel staff at reception. Data for hotel staff and admin is assumed to be collected from the hotel’s Human Resource Management System (HRMS).
Static data about the mobile robots is manually entered into the system by hotel staff whenever new robots are added to the fleet. Dynamic data from the robots such as their location and battery status will be transmitted from the robots to the database using protocols such as MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT) or through web REST API. How the raw data from the robots is transferred and stored in the database before it is saved as an attribute in different tables is beyond the scope of this project. 
Data for suppliers is automatically fetched from third party systems such as ecommerce and logistic applications. If the senders do not use these technologies, the corresponding data for suppliers is manually entered by the hotel staff. Static data related to buildings, rooms, robot charging stations, and elevators are also manually entered by the hotel staff.
2.2.2. Relationship between Entities
The following is a list of constraints on the relationships that exist between the entities.
•	There is at least one elevator in each building.
•	There is at least one charging station in each building.
•	Each building will have at least one robot for the delivery operation. A robot could either be located in an elevator, charging station, or somewhere else in the building.
•	All users in the system are either guests or staff. A staff member works a single shift every day of the week.
•	There is at least one room that guests could reserve in each building.
•	Each guest will have at least one emergency contact registered in the system.
•	Each guest will be assigned to one and only one room.
•	Each package is delivered by a single supplier to a single guest. On the other hand, each supplier could ship multiple packages.
•	A single staff member will be assigned for each package that arrives at the hotel. A staff member could be responsible for multiple packages.
•	Each package is tracked by a unique delivery id.
•	For every delivery, there could be multiple notifications that could be sent to the guest. 
•	If a guest is to be deleted from the system, data related to their emergency contact, packages, delivery, and notifications will have to be deleted.

2.2.3. Delivery Process
The package is first shipped to the hotel once an order is made by the guests using an external system. Once the package arrives at the hotel, it is moved to the storage room to be inspected and registered in the system by a hotel staff. The hotel staff then logs the package into the database system and initiates a delivery process. Once the delivery is initialized, guests will get a push notification telling them that their package is on the way.
After inspection, if the package is found to be too heavy or needs careful handling, it is directly delivered by the hotel staff to the guests. Otherwise, the package will be delivered by a mobile robot with a self-driving capability. The robot selection is automatically done by the system based on the size and weight of the package and the availability of a suitable robot. Once an appropriate robot is selected by the system, the robot is instructed to move to the storage room to pick up the package.
After picking up the package, the robot moves to a predetermined elevator and moves to the floor where the guest’s room is located at. The robot exits the elevator and moves to the guest's room. Once it arrives at the door of the guest’s room, the guest will get a push notification telling them that their package has arrived.
After the guest receives their package, they get an option to leave a review about the delivery. This will ensure the staff know of any complaints the guests may have about the delivery. Once the robot completes the delivery, it will make its status available unless it must go to a nearby charging station to charge its battery.

2.2.4. Robot Selection
A robot is selected for a given delivery based on the following criteria.
a.	The robot should have enough battery capacity to complete the delivery.
b.	The robot should have enough space to hold a package. It should also have enough capacity to sustain the weight of the package.
c.	A robot that will have to travel the least distance is selected for the delivery. For example, if there are two available robots on the 3rd and 5th floors and the package is to be delivered to a room on the 10th floor, the robot on the 3rd floor will be chosen for the delivery assuming that the storage room is located on the 1st floor.
 
2.3. Sample Output
The database is expected to be used to give answers to queries the system needs to know for the delivery system to work efficiently. Below are some example queries that could be answered using the database:
a.	A package weighs 5lb and volume is classified as medium size. Which robots can deliver this package?
b.	The package mentioned in (a) is to be delivered to the 10th floor, which robots travel the least distance when making the delivery?
c.	Among the robots that are chosen in (b), which ones have sufficient battery capacity to complete the delivery?
d.	What is the nearest empty charging station that a given robot could use to charge its batteries?
e.	How many robots are there on a given floor?
 
The database could also serve as a valuable resource for generating internal analytic reports, which, in turn, could point out potentially inefficient practices and help improve the overall business process. Some questions that could be answered based on the data collected in the database are listed below.
a.	What was the average number of customers who used the hotel delivery system each month? 
b.	What was the average rating of the delivery service for each corresponding month? 
c.	How many robots were used to complete delivery operations during each month?
d.	What percentage of the guests who booked into the hotel used the hotel’s delivery system for each month?

2.4. Other Assumptions
Assumptions that were made when specifying the data requirements of the hotel package delivery system include the following:
·	The hotel package management system seamlessly integrates with third-party systems, such as ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) and logistic systems, enabling the automated retrieval of data concerning hotel staff members involved in package deliveries and details regarding the package senders.
·	User permissions and roles will be clearly defined and controlled at the application level. This ensures that each category of users operates within predefined parameters, thus safeguarding data and system integrity.
·	The robots deployed for package delivery are assumed to be equipped with advanced sensors, enabling them to gain awareness of their surroundings. These sensors will allow for precise location determination and obstacle avoidance. Additionally, the robots will possess path-planning capabilities to efficiently reach desired destinations.
·	Each robot is assumed to manage its own separate system and database, localized on the robot itself. The robots can communicate among themselves and with a central server with access to the database designed in this project. This setup is designed to support the seamless execution of their software, ensuring operational efficiency and independence of each robotic entity. The design of the local database for each robot is beyond the scope of this project.
